# Tokenomics Change

## Overview

This document outlines the proposed changes to the tokenomics of the platform's native token. These changes are designed to improve the long-term sustainability of the ecosystem and better align the interests of stakeholders.

## Changes

1. **Token Supply Adjustment:**
   - The total supply of tokens will be adjusted to a lower fixed supply to create more scarcity and potential value appreciation.
   - A deflationary mechanism will be introduced to burn a portion of tokens with each transaction, reducing the overall supply over time.

2. **Staking Rewards Update:**
   - Staking rewards will be increased to encourage more users to stake their tokens and participate in network security.
   - The staking mechanism will include lock-up periods with varying reward rates to incentivize longer-term staking.

3. **Transaction Fees:**
   - A small percentage of transaction fees will be redirected to a community fund, which will be governed by token holders.
   - The remaining portion of transaction fees will be used to burn tokens, contributing to the deflationary model.

4. **Governance Token Integration:**
   - Token holders will be able to use their tokens to participate in governance decisions, such as voting on platform updates or proposals related to the tokenomics.

5. **Liquidity Incentives:**
   - New liquidity mining programs will be introduced to incentivize liquidity providers to contribute to the platform's liquidity pools.

## Rationale

- **Scarcity and Value Appreciation**: Reducing the total token supply and implementing deflationary mechanisms will help increase the tokenâ€™s value over time.
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Adjusting staking rewards and introducing lock-up periods encourages users to engage more deeply with the platform, leading to greater token retention.
- **Decentralization**: Allowing token holders to vote on key tokenomics changes aligns the platform with decentralized governance principles.

## Action Items

- Update the token smart contract to reflect the changes in total supply and transaction fee structure.
- Implement the new staking rewards and liquidity mining programs.
