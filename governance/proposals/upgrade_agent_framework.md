# Upgrade to Agent Framework

## Overview

This document outlines the proposed upgrades to the agent framework, which is responsible for managing agents within the platform. The framework upgrade aims to enhance agent performance, introduce new functionalities, and improve overall efficiency.

## Changes

1. **Agent Role Management:**
   - New roles will be introduced for agents, including "Super Admin," "Moderator," and "Viewer." These roles will come with different levels of access and permissions.
   - A permissions matrix will be created to ensure each role's capabilities are clearly defined.

2. **Agent Registration Process:**
   - The agent registration process will be streamlined, with an updated interface that allows agents to register, update their information, and view their current status.
   - New agents will be required to undergo an approval process before being added to the platform.

3. **Agent Activity Tracking:**
   - Enhanced agent activity tracking will be implemented. This will log the actions performed by each agent, including their interactions with users and other agents, and make this data accessible for auditing purposes.
   
4. **Smart Contract Integration:**
   - The agent framework will be integrated with the governance smart contract, enabling agents to participate in governance decisions based on their role and permission level.

5. **Agent Notification System:**
   - An agent notification system will be introduced to keep agents informed of important updates, proposals, and actions requiring their attention.

## Rationale

- **Better Role Definition**: Clear roles and permissions ensure that agents know their responsibilities and limitations, enhancing overall platform security.
- **Streamlined Registration**: Making the agent registration process simpler and faster improves user experience and platform adoption.
- **Accountability**: Tracking agent activity ensures transparency and makes it easier to detect and address malicious or unauthorized actions.

## Action Items

- Implement the new agent roles and permissions framework in the backend.
- Update the frontend to reflect the new agent registration process and activity tracking.
- Integrate the agent system with the governance smart contract to allow for governance participation.
- Test the agent notification system and ensure it is functioning properly.
- Update the agent framework documentation and train internal teams on the new features.

## Next Steps

1. Discuss the proposed changes in the governance forum.
2. Implement the changes in the development environment.
3. Run tests to ensure the agent framework operates smoothly with the new features.
4. Deploy the updated framework to production.
5. Monitor the new framework and collect feedback for future improvements.
